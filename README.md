This is my first time making a project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as well as my first time using GitHub.

This project is a simple client side calculator to help Elden Ring players find how much endurance they need to carry a loadout effectively. 
The only custom input neccessary is the numerical equip load, as otherwise everthing else is dropdown menus.
I derived the formulas used to calculate everything using the information on https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki,
specifically, the page on Equip load.
